This script allows you to extract Journal metadata from a Sugar Journal backup or several journal backups. These are usually found on the OLPC XS School Server under /library/users/


At the terminal prompt
run the script by typing:

>> python olpc_dataprocessor.py journals_data.csv


This will create a file called journals_data.csv Open in a text editor or import into a spreadsheet or database or statistical analysis package. Thats it! 

Comma Separated Values (CSV), OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS), and Microsoft Excel (XLS) formats of sample data are included. These were extracted from three OLPC XO laptops with arbitrary data. The source data (folders begin with SH*) are also included.
